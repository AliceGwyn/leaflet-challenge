To view the visualizations, make sure you have both the index.html file and the static folder containing logic.js, then open this folder in VS code and 'Open with Live Server' on the index.html file by right clicking on the file name in the explorer panel.

This will open a webpage showing a map with the last 7 days of earthquakes mapped out. Quakes closer to the surface are blue, deeper ones are red, as shown in the legend. The size of the circle for each quake is determined by the magnitude of the quake, with larger magnitudes producing larger circle. You can also click on each circle to see a popup with the magnitude, depth, and location of each earthquake.
